# RayTracer-with-customizable-SkyBox
This is the fully built Ray Tracer project that is gone over by TheCherno (https://github.com/TheCherno) on You Tube.  This has the same features (sadly the built in multithreading tool is not working on my VS) however, this also has a new customizable SkyBox feature which allows the user to customize the sky which ever color they like.
